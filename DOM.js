//Document Object Model
/*
The DOM is a W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) standard.
The DOM defines a standard for accessing documents:
The W3C DOM standard is separated into 3 different parts:
    Core DOM - standard model for all document types
    XML DOM - standard model for XML documents
    HTML DOM - standard model for HTML documents

// HTML DOM Methods
/*
The HTML DOM can be accessed with JavaScript (and with other programming languages).
In the DOM, all HTML elements are defined as objects.
The programming interface is the properties and methods of each object.
A property is a value that you can get or set (like changing the content of an HTML element).
A method is an action you can do (like add or deleting an HTML element).
*/

//The getElementById Method
// The most common way to access an HTML element is to use the id of the element.
